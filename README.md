## Installation

### Via sbt

Add those lines into your build.sbt file

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("recast-ai", "generic")

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "ai.recast" %% "sdk_scala" % "0.7.0"
  )
```

## Usage

### Module

```scala
import recast.client._

object HelloBot {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val client = new Client("YOUR_TOKEN")

    try {
      val response = client.textRequest("Hello")
      // Do your code
      response.intent() match {
        Some("hello-greetings") => println("Hello, world")
        _ => println("I didn't understand, sorry !")
      }
    } catch {
      // handle error
      case _ => println("Something went wrong...")
    }
  }
}
```

## Specs

### Classes

This package contains 5 classes, as follow:

* Client is the client allowing you to make requests to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API.
* Reponse contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai)
* Sentence represents a sentence of the response
* Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastError is the error thrown by the module

### Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token (optional) and a language (optional), and provides the following methods:
* textRequest(text, options) *Performs a text request. text is a String, options is a Map(String, String)*
* fileRequest(text, options) *Performs a voice file request. file is a String, options is a Map(String, String)*

On each call to `textRequest` or `fileRequest` you can override either your token or your language by passing a hash of options.

If no language is provided in the request, Recast.AI does the following:

* textRequest: the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expression for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
* voiceRequest: your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.

If a language is provided, it must be one of the following:
  - en *for English*
  - fr *for French*

*Accepted options are: token, language, to override the defaults provided at initialization*

```scala
import recast.client.Client

object TestBot {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val client = new Client("YOUR_TOKEN")
    
    try {
      var response = client.textRequest("Hello, world")
    } catch {
      // handle error
    }
    // do your code


    try {
      var response = client.fileRequest("Hello, world")
    } catch {
      // handle error
    }
    // do your code
  }
}
```

### Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call to textRequest or fileRequest and contains the following methods:
* sentence(\*) *Returns the first detected sentence*
* all(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* get(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* intent(\*) *Returns the first matched intent*

In addition, you can access each of these attributes:
* raw *The raw, unparsed response*
* source *The source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents *An Option containing all the matched intents*
* sentences *All the detected sentences*
* version *The version of the JSON*
* timestamp *The timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status *The status if the response*

```scala
val response = client.textRequest("Give me a recipe with asparagus. And tomatoes.")

val intent = response.intent()
val ingredient = response.get("ingredient")
val sentence = response.sentence()

intent.match {
  case Some("recipe") => // send a response
  case _ => // No intent matched
}
```

### Sentence

The Recast.AI Sentence is generated by the Recast.AI Response constructor and provides the following methods:
* get(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*

In addition, you can access each of these attributes
* source *The source of the sentence*
* sentence_type *An Option containing the type of the sentence*
* action *An Option containing the action of the sentence*
* agent *An Option containing the agent of the sentence*
* polarity *An Option containing the polarity of the sentence*
* entities *An array containing all the entities detected in the sentence*

### Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence constructor and provides the following attribute:
* name *The name of the entity*

In addition, more methods are provided, returning an Option containing either the value of the field, or None if this field is not present in the entity:
* raw(\*)
* value(\*)
* hex(\*)
* deg(\*)
* formated(\*)
* lng(\*)
* lat(\*)
* unit(\*)
* code(\*)
* person(\*)
* number(\*)
* gender(\*)
* next(\*)
* grain(\*)
* order(\*)

### RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving a non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from Error, it implements the default Error methods.
